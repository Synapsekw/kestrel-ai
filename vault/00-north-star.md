# Kestrel AI — North star

This is the Obsidian homepage for the Kestrel AI vault. Read this first, on any machine.

## 1. Pitch

**Kestrel AI** is a Windows desktop app that takes a construction team from a folder of aerial
drone frames to a trained machinery detector and reviewed counts, without a terminal and without
reading documentation. It covers dataset preparation, bounding-box annotation, YOLO training with a
model registry, and inference with either local models or OpenAI/Anthropic vision models — replacing
Label Studio, ad-hoc scripts and the Ultralytics CLI (`PRODUCT.md`).

Stack (`README.md`):

| Part | What | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/` | FastAPI sidecar: projects, datasets, annotation storage, jobs, training, inference | Python 3.11.15, uv, pytest, ruff, PyInstaller |
| `frontend/` | Tauri 2 shell with the React/TypeScript/Vite UI | pnpm, Vitest, Playwright, Rust stable MSVC |
| `contract/` | `openapi.yaml` (source of truth), generated TS client, Prism mock server | pnpm |

Master spec: [[2026-09-17-kestrel-ai-app-design]]. Product context: [[product]]. Architecture map:

## 2. Where we are

Renamed from "Machinery Detection" / `machinery-app` to **Kestrel AI** / `kestrel-ai` on
2026-09-20 (full name map: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-kestrel-ai-rename-design.md` §2.1).
The evidence and checkpoints below predate the rename and keep the old names on purpose — that is
deliberate history, not an error.

All of the core-pipeline waves (S0–S6) are merged to `main`:

- Wave 0 (S0 contract and scaffolding) — merged, checkpoint 1 passed.
- Wave 1 (S1 dataset backend, S2 annotation UI, S3 training backend and registry) — merged,
  checkpoint 2 passed (backend and editor halves), GPU training verified on `main`.
- Wave 2 (S4 inference and providers, S5 training/inference UI) — merged after 2 fix rounds each,
  checkpoint 3 passed.
- Wave 3 (S6 packaging and acceptance) — merged after 2 fix rounds, checkpoint 4 passed.

Last verified checkpoint: 4 (after Wave 3) on main `826a3bf` (installed app), 2026-09-18.

On top of that, the Phase 2 usability wave and the site-office UI redesign are also merged to
`main`, and acceptance step 7 has since closed 8/8 on the installed app at `177f68b` (2026-09-20) —
see §3 for the breakdown and §5 for why that figure is not the last word.

## 3. Phases

| Phase | Status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Wave 0 — S0 contract & scaffolding | merged | checkpoint 1 passed |
| Wave 1 — S1 dataset backend, S2 annotation UI, S3 training backend & registry | merged | checkpoint 2 passed (backend + editor); GPU training verified on `main` |
| Wave 2 — S4 inference & providers, S5 training/inference UI | merged (2 fix rounds each) | checkpoint 3 passed |
| Wave 3 — S6 packaging & acceptance | merged (2 fix rounds) | checkpoint 4 passed; acceptance run passed, step 7 skipped (no provider key at the time) |
| Phase 2: usability (goal 2) — friction-list fixes, starter weights, negative images, Datasets screen, results export | merged to `main` | acceptance closed 8/8 on the installed app (`177f68b`), step 7 with a stored provider key; friction list closed except G3 and G2/M3 (see §5) |
| Site office UI redesign (U2) | merged to `main` (`2bc15a4`) | every screen restyled on `frontend/src/ui/`; walk-through 12 steps / 66 checks against the real backend |
| Kestrel AI rename | naming and code renamed 2026-09-20 | acceptance has **not** been re-run against the renamed installed build — see §5 |

## 4. Now

**Shipped last:** acceptance step 7 (H2) closed 8/8 on the installed app at `177f68b`
(2026-09-20), following the usability wave and the site-office UI redesign merging to `main`
(`2bc15a4`).

**In flight:** the product and app code carry the Kestrel AI name (renamed 2026-09-20); this vault
and the public-repo preparation it belongs to are being built now (plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-20-repo-and-dev-memory.md`).

**Next:** re-run acceptance against the renamed, installed Kestrel AI build (§5); close the
outstanding friction-list minors G3 and G2/M3 (§5).

## 5. Owed

### Stale acceptance run (blocking claim of a current PASS)

`docs/progress.md` records an **8/8 PASS** for the acceptance run (spec 13.5), but that figure was
measured on the **pre-rename** build at commit `9f3aa01` (product then still named "Machinery
Detection"). **It has not been re-run against the renamed, installed Kestrel AI build.** Do not
read the 8/8 as current. This is tracked as **Task 11 Step 5** of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-20-kestrel-ai-rename.md` ("Re-run acceptance ... The previous 8/8
was measured on the old build and is stale until this passes").

### Other open items found while reading `docs/progress.md`

- **G3** (class labels on report thumbnails) — noted open after usability wave 1
  ("`G3 (class labels on report thumbnails) after this wave`"); no later entry in `docs/progress.md`
  records it closed.
- **G2/M3** — a minor item deferred within the results-export work
  ("`every item closed except G2/M3 (in G2) and H2`"); H2 (acceptance step 7) has since closed
  (2026-09-20), but `docs/progress.md` records no resolution for G2/M3.
